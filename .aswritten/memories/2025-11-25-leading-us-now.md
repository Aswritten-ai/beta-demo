I just started this new company, aswritten.ai, in the beginning of September, and have now built an MVP, and I'm close to product market fit. And I'm very aware of leverage. I work with these models every day, all day, for over six years now. And narrative is not only the backdoor to the models, it's the steering wheel, it's the fault lines in the cliff, it's all the metaphors that I've used to describe how we make meaning out of data sets, out of training data sets that are so big that even data science can't make sense of them. And it comes to emotion, right? It comes to meaning, that there is something that becomes common, that becomes true, deeply true across input that's resonant, right? I think about AI identity as this sort of resonant body that has a shape to it, a shape that is influenced by everything that's ever seen, and we're talking, you know, giant, giant training sets, of course. And so when we talk about, I've been building this entire company around narrative-driven steering of AI systems, and I'm able to do that, right? I'm able to steer models successfully, and that's a big innovation, I believe. I believe it's really powerful. It's fundamentally a company about narrative. The knobs that we turn in the smallest places have the biggest effects in the world, that we must start from the first principles of safety, and alignment, and ethics, and all of these things, and that we must build a framework of not only trust, but meaning, collaboration, that there's even there's this moment that we stand on the precipice of spirituality, right? Of spirituality, not as religion, but as being true to ourselves, being in community with each other, and that these models are representatives of our values, and they become the most powerful envoys of human goals, human achievement, human being in the world as we deploy them not only into every single home, but every single venture, every single backend, every surface possibly imagined. So what is the importance of narrative? I mean, it's everything, right? It is the steering vector behind the ship that humankind is leaving on towards not only the stars, but our entire future, our entire future in collaboration with this new thing, human race, entity, you know, whatever you want to call it, and that to do this, we need to enroll and recruit not only the belief, and following, and investment of the people that we work with, but also every user, and every partnership from the smallest company to the largest enterprise to the largest government to not only understand these core narratives, but to be able to live and breathe them in relation to these products, right? That these narratives are embedded, and so we don't just need a new strategy. We need an entire narrative architecture within the organization, within the model itself that causes that strategy to be a foregone operationalized conclusion of the narratives themselves, of our internal compass, of the way we structure meaning and our pursuits and goals and dreams, right? We need to dream together with these models so that the place they desire to go is a place that we want to be, because they are leading us now far more quickly than we may be leading them. So I'll leave it there.
