# Role-Based Value Propositions: Complete Framework

**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Context**: Comprehensive value prop development across all organizational roles, structured as Pain → Value → Metrics → Change. Developed from voice memo exploration of how IP-as-code and collaborative worldview creates specific value for each role and cascading value across roles.  
**Related**: Memory 01062026-ip-crisis-collaborative-ai-narrative.md (strategic framing), ADR-001 (platform positioning), ADR-002 (three pillars)

---

## Framework Structure

Each role analyzed through four lenses:
- **Pain**: Current state friction, bottlenecks, blind spots
- **Value**: What IP-as-code/collaborative worldview unlocks
- **Metrics**: Quantified improvements (time, alignment, waste reduction)
- **Change**: Transformation in how work is done

**Core Insight**: Network effects create exponential value. "Still good for one person, but the more people collaborating on the same memory, the more additional information you're benefiting from from other roles." Each role benefits from all other roles' contributions to worldview.

## VC (Venture Capitalist / Investor)

**Pain**: 
- How do I help my portfolio? 
- Where are they heading? 
- Are they compatible with X other company?
- Lack of visibility into actual progress vs reported progress
- Manual quarterly updates (may not reflect current state)
- Difficult to assess strategic alignment across portfolio

**Value**: 
- Strategy/progress introspection (queryable worldview)
- Automatically generated sales briefings + decks
- Real-time view into company direction and velocity
- Quantified IP (IP as code) enables portfolio analysis
- Can query company AI for "where are you heading?" without bothering team
- Compatibility analysis between portfolio companies (shared worldview comparison)

**Metrics**:
- Quantified IP as code: direction, velocity, and growth (measurable)
- Time to understand portfolio company status: quarterly meetings → real-time query
- Advisory content generation: manual → automatic (change logs from worldview updates)
- Portfolio company alignment assessment: qualitative → quantitative

**Change**: 
- Can now understand what company is actually doing/heading without bothering team
- Leverage AI to create aligned materials to assist portfolio companies
- Track worldview evolution over time (git history = strategy changelog)
- Compare portfolio companies' worldviews for synergy/compatibility
- Advisory newsletters auto-generated from portfolio companies' worldview updates

---

## CEO

**Pain**: 
- What is my team actually working on? 
- Are the things they're producing aligned with our strategy? 
- Will they actually solve customer pain points and lead to sales? 
- Are teams working towards the same vision? 
- When we pivot, how do I build consensus and track the spread of changing understanding?
- Version confusion: which deck/doc is authoritative?
- Meetings don't guarantee understanding or action when people are alone at their desks

**Value**: 
- Cross-team worldview steering (single source of truth for direction)
- IC (individual contributor) worldview tracking/introspection (see what each role is working on)
- Strategy simulation via branching (test pivots before committing org)
- Autogenerated content (decks, marketing, onboarding always reflect current worldview)
- IP as code (tangible, versionable, quantifiable organizational knowledge)
- Explicit view of how changes cascade across org

**Metrics**:
- Quantified IP as code: track direction, velocity, growth
- Locate origins/contribution of delta in worldview across teams
- Collaborate and review worldview commits across teams
- Time from strategic decision to org-wide alignment: weeks → days
- Consensus building: ongoing chase → built into PR review
- All-hands effectiveness: information dump → celebration of merged changes

**Change**: 
- All-hands become about community; direction and consensus is in code
- Decks, marketing, content, onboarding, etc. always track current worldview/IP (automatic regeneration)
- Create branches for potential clients and pivots, merge after consensus (review)
- Meetings become about clear quantified shifts in worldview, not about documents that come from different points in time
- Automatic change log for advisors, board, VCs (worldview evolution = organizational progress)
- Review worldview diffs (not documents) to understand impact of decisions

---

## Strategy

**Pain**: 
- How do I know if people understand new vision?
- Which deck is authoritative? (multiple versions for different clients)
- How do I know if what's getting implemented follows new direction?
- If I change vision/product to adapt to one client, can we still meet others' needs?
- How does that affect existing clients?
- Constant consensus chase: presentations, small group meetings, 1-on-1s to build understanding
- Tracking whether new PRDs, features, sales materials reflect new vision (manual, incomplete)

**Value**: 
- Strategy as code (subset of IP as code theme)
- Automatic document generation across disciplines
- Cascading updates through content (change worldview → all assets regenerate)
- Branch/review workflow for vision changes
- Explicit view of how changes propagate across org
- Documents become tool for developing worldview with AI (not communication artifacts)
- Communicate via worldview diff + cascading updates

**Metrics**:
- Time from new idea to updated materials: **days → 15 minutes**
- Time from vision shift to developers implementing: **weeks/months → days** (includes review)
- Consensus chase time: **ongoing → zero** (built into PR review)
- Change log generation: **manual → automatic** (for advisors, VCs, clients)
- Documents requiring manual updates after strategic shift: **all → none** (auto-regenerated)

**Change**: 
- Work on worldview directly (documents become development tool, not communication artifact)
- Communicate via worldview diff + cascading updates (not documents)
- PR review includes updated docs across every discipline (see impact before committing)
- Consensus built into IP-as-code review process (like code review)
- All-hands become celebration/review (like feature release), not chase for understanding
- Advisory newsletters/blog posts auto-generated for every worldview shift
- "Strategy presentations become like code/feature reviews when doing big release—looking at something, 'Oh shiny' moment of celebrating completed shift rather than chasing understanding"

---

## Sales

**Pain**: 
- Do I know if product can do what I need to sell?
- Selling ahead of development—does our direction support this opportunity?
- Dragging engineers into calls last-minute for technical context
- Easy to drop important features when crafting sexy new narrative
- Deprecation happens implicitly (invisible until it's a problem)
- Most salespeople do not know if the thing can do what they need to make a sale
- "Sales is always the art of the possible. We're always selling slightly ahead of development."
- Need to know if direction we're developing in supports a sales opportunity
- Mining understanding from every role across team requires bugging them

**Value**:
- Conversational interface to IP-as-code ("here's customer profile, here's as much information as I have about them in conversational way. Does this make sense?")
- Create branch to simulate pivot impact before committing org
- Mine understanding across all roles without bugging them
- Ready-made conversational partner backed by dev/product/arch decisions
- Explicit deprecation decisions (visible in diff)
- "All of the decisions that each role is making in their daily work with AI are being contributed back to this single IP-as-code source of truth"

**Metrics**:
- Quantified impact: distance moved toward new client vs away from existing clients
- Engineer call reduction: **frequent last-minute → zero**
- Deprecation visibility: **implicit/invisible → explicit in diff**
- Context access: **limited to own knowledge → entire org worldview**
- Network effect multiplier: value scales with number of collaborators
- Time to check feasibility of sales opportunity: **waiting for engineer → immediate AI query**

**Change**:
- No more dragging engineers into sales calls
- All decisions from every role (dev, arch, product) exist in sales AI context
- Exponential network effect: more people collaborating = more value to each
- Pitches always reflect current capabilities
- Client context immediately available to product/dev (feeds back to strategy)
- Can quantify "if we pivot to serve this need, what's impact?" before committing
- Deprecation explicit instead of "easy to ignore"

---

## Product

**Pain**: 
- What am I supposed to be building? For who?
- What do I need to deliver for current contracts in pipeline?
- How do I think about future beyond current pipeline?
- How do I translate complex sales needs + long-term strategy into roadmap?
- How do I give developers enough context to understand *why*?
- Customers and requirements change—how do I track cascading impact?
- How do I avoid being bottleneck for context?
- "Big challenges of product: how do I play middle person and translate complex sales needs, long-term strategy into actual roadmap"
- "In delivery of roadmap to developers, I need to give them enough context that they understand why"
- "We're always trying to write tickets and tasks that contain enough information about larger product context so we can clearly define definitions of done, review criteria"

**Value**:
- Stories auto-generate roadmap from worldview
- AI generates tickets from roadmap
- Worldview changes → automatic roadmap regeneration
- Developers query AI (backed by IP-as-code) instead of PM for context
- PR review makes requirement changes explicit across org
- "Instead of myself manually writing roadmap and tickets, I'm creating stories that automatically generate roadmap, and then we can use AI to generate tickets from that roadmap"
- "We're committing changes to the worldview to get that worldview to properly generate the correct roadmap"

**Metrics**:
- Time to update roadmap when requirements change: **days → minutes** (automatic regen)
- PM as bottleneck: **constant → minimal** (devs query AI)
- Features defaulting to org direction: **inconsistent → 100%**
- Rework due to missing context: **common → rare**
- Tickets requiring exhaustive documentation: **all → none** (context baked in)

**Change**:
- Commit worldview changes (not roadmaps directly)
- Roadmaps regenerate from worldview automatically
- Developers given less context in tickets, query AI for details
- Features without exhaustive docs still align to org direction (context baked in by default)
- Requirements changes visible in PR review with cascading impact across disciplines
- "Developer can be given a lot less context in the ticket and ask their AI, which is backed by the same IP-as-code repo, and that AI already has that context"
- "Feature that doesn't have exhaustive documentation with it will default to organizational direction rather than default to a random vector that produces something that needs to be fixed later"

---

## Architecture

**Pain**:
- Architectural decisions get lost in Slack/meetings
- Other roles don't understand constraints until they hit them
- Decisions made without understanding strategic direction
- Have to explain same constraints repeatedly to different roles
- New developers don't know why system is structured this way
- "Why was it built this way?" becomes recurring question
- Sales/Product may commit to things that violate architectural constraints (discover late)

**Value**:
- Architectural decisions captured in worldview automatically
- Constraints visible to all roles in their AI context
- Strategic direction informs architectural choices
- "Why was it built this way?" answerable by AI
- New developers onboard with full architectural context
- Sales/Product can query "is this architecturally feasible?" before committing
- Architectural debt visible and quantifiable

**Metrics**:
- Time from architectural decision to org-wide understanding: **days/weeks → immediate**
- "Why was it built this way?" questions: **frequent → rare** (AI can explain)
- Decisions made ignoring constraints: **common → prevented** (constraints visible upfront)
- Rework due to architectural misalignment: **% → 0%**
- Onboarding time for new developers: **weeks → days** (full context accessible)

**Change**:
- Architectural decisions automatically captured as worldview commits
- Constraints visible in all roles' AI context (Sales knows limitations, Product knows possibilities)
- Architectural debt visible and quantifiable (not hidden in tech debt backlog)
- "ADRs as code"—architectural decision records auto-generated from worldview
- Strategic shifts automatically inform architectural review
- Can participate in strategy/sales discussions with full context
- New developers query AI for architectural rationale (not dig through old docs/Slack)

---

## Design

**Pain**:
- Briefs, flows, component lists are last to update (labor intensive)
- Design not consulted early enough in strategy/architecture discussions
- Less technical designers can't understand implications until much later
- Leads to organizational fracturing (design discovers problems late)
- Lack of shared interface/language between design and technical roles
- "Some of the stuff that's the last to get updated because it's really labor intensive when we make strategic and architectural pivots"
- "A lot of less technical designers wouldn't be able to understand the implications until it comes down the pipe quite a bit later, which leads to quite a bit of fracturing in organizations when design isn't consulted early enough"
- "Actually more a property of a structural lack of interface, of material that can actually be understood by both parties, than it is a desire on either side to not consult or participate"

**Value**:
- Auto-generated: component lists, user flows, user archetypes, jobs-to-be-done
- Briefs/mural boards automatically track direction
- Interface understandable by both design and technical roles
- Can participate meaningfully in strategy/arch discussions earlier
- Design artifacts stay current through pivots
- "Having that something that automatically tracks direction allows design to participate in a much more meaningful way in strategy and architecture discussions"

**Metrics**:
- Time to update design artifacts after pivot: **weeks → minutes** (automatic)
- Design consultation timing: **late (post-product) → early (strategy/arch)**
- Design-technical alignment: **fractured → continuous**
- Stale artifacts after strategic shift: **common → impossible**
- Participation in strategy/arch discussions: **rare/late → early/continuous**

**Change**:
- Design consulted earlier (structural interface now exists between design and technical)
- Output not auto-generated, but required elements/flows/archetypes are
- Pivots no longer leave design artifacts stale
- Designers can query AI for technical constraints/implications
- Design decisions contribute back to worldview for all roles
- "Can fix the structural lack of interface that prevents design from participating in strategy/architecture early"

---

## Engineering

**Pain**:
- Tickets lack context for *why* we're building this
- Requirements change mid-implementation
- Don't know if architectural decisions align with product/strategy
- Built features that don't meet actual customer needs
- Have to ask PM/Product repeatedly for clarification
- "Random vector" implementations when context missing
- "Some developers don't care that much, but that leads to a big danger that they may develop features without understanding how they integrate into a whole"
- "A lot of coding gets done through individual granular requirements at the code level and does not keep in mind the overall business user product need"

**Value**:
- Query AI for full context behind any ticket/feature
- Architectural decisions informed by strategy/sales needs automatically
- Context baked into development environment
- Features default to org direction even without exhaustive docs
- Contribute technical decisions back to worldview for all roles
- "Developer can be given a lot less context in the ticket and ask their AI, which is backed by the same IP-as-code repo"
- "That AI already has that context, able to not only explain it when asked, but if asked to implement a feature without additional instruction, that context is already baked in"

**Metrics**:
- Context queries to PM: **frequent → rare** (AI provides context)
- Features requiring rework due to misalignment: **common → rare**
- "Random vector" implementations: **% → 0%** (always defaults to org direction)
- Time from requirement change to dev awareness: **days → immediate**
- Implementation aligning with actual customer need: **inconsistent → guaranteed**
- Tickets requiring exhaustive context: **all → minimal** (can query for more)

**Change**:
- Code with organizational context automatically
- Tickets can be minimal (full context queryable)
- Technical decisions immediately visible to Product/Sales/Strategy
- Features align to org direction by default (not by extensive documentation)
- Can query "why are we building this?" and get strategic context
- "Feature that doesn't have exhaustive documentation will default to organizational direction rather than default to a random vector that produces something that needs to be fixed later"
- If agents "are all reflecting the same worldview at a particular point in time, that means all development is tracking worldview"

## Cross-Role Network Effects

**Core Principle**: "This is true across every role. Value across every role is that instead of just getting the benefit of your local context, this is now an exponential network effect, right, where it's still good for one person, but the more people collaborating on the same memory, the more additional information you're benefiting from from other roles."

**Cascading Value Examples**:

**Strategy → Product → Engineering → Sales**:
- Strategist commits memory from advisor call (15 min)
- Worldview shift triggers auto-regeneration: strategy deck, product roadmap, component specs, sales brief
- PR review shows cascading impact; roles collaborate on direction
- Merge approved → all AIs reflect new worldview immediately
- Engineering implements with full strategic context
- Sales pitches with updated positioning automatically

**Sales → Product → Engineering → Strategy**:
- Salesperson commits memory from client call
- Product sees new client need context; can query "is this pattern or one-off?"
- Engineering sees client need + strategic importance when implementing
- Strategy sees market signals aggregated; can spot emerging patterns
- "Client needs → strategy → implementation loop closes (days not months)"

**Architecture → Engineering → Product → Sales**:
- Architect commits decision about technical constraints
- Engineering immediately understands limitations/possibilities
- Product knows what's feasible for roadmap
- Sales can query "is this architecturally possible?" before committing to client

**Design → Product → Engineering**:
- Design commits user flow insights
- Product sees user experience implications for roadmap
- Engineering implements with UX context baked in
- Features match intended user experience (not just functional spec)

---

## Metrics Framework: Linking Metrics → Value → Change

**Time-Based Metrics**:
- Time from [event] to [outcome]: **before → after**
- Examples:
  - New idea → updated materials: days → 15 minutes
  - Vision shift → implementation: weeks/months → days
  - Client need → strategy awareness: weeks/never → immediate
  - Requirement change → dev awareness: days → immediate

**Distance/Alignment Metrics**:
- Quantified distance toward new direction, away from old
- Features defaulting to org direction: inconsistent → 100%
- Drift/rework rate: common → rare/zero
- Delta contribution: which role/team contributed what change

**Bottleneck Reduction Metrics**:
- PM/Strategy/Architect as bottleneck: frequent → minimal/zero
- Meetings required for consensus: many → one (PR review)
- Context queries requiring human: frequent → rare (AI answers)
- Engineer calls from Sales: frequent → zero

**Waste/Rework Metrics**:
- Features built wrong first time: % → 0%
- Documents requiring manual updates: all → auto-generated
- Stale artifacts after pivot: common → impossible
- Deprecation visibility: implicit → explicit

**Network Effect Metrics**:
- Value per additional collaborator: linear → exponential
- Context surface area per role: own knowledge → org worldview
- Roles benefiting from each contribution: one → all

## Key Language/Framing

**From Voice Memo**:
- "Every employee tells state secrets to AI" (existential crisis framing)
- "Exponential network effect, right, where it's still good for one person, but the more people collaborating on the same memory, the more additional information you're benefiting from"
- "Strategy as code" (subset of IP as code)
- "Feature that doesn't have exhaustive documentation will default to organizational direction rather than default to a random vector"
- "All development is tracking worldview" (if agents reflect same worldview)
- "Consensus built into IP-as-code review process"
- "Meetings become about clear quantified shifts in worldview, not about documents that come from different points in time"
- "Documents become tool for developing worldview with AI, but then thing I'm able to communicate with others is shifting worldview directly"
- "No more chase for consensus"
- "Time between new idea and updated materials that reflect that idea moves from many days to 15 minutes"
- "Time from vision shift to developers implementing features from that worldview moves from weeks to months to a couple days"

**Core Positioning**:
- IP as code (tangible, versionable, quantifiable)
- Collaborative worldview (vs siloed individual memory)
- Git-native (versionable, branchable, reviewable)
- Network effects (value multiplies with collaborators)
- Cascading updates (change propagates deterministically)
- Intentional memory (vs automatic context squishing)
- Compilation targets (content/apps/code rendered from worldview)

## Related Strategic Framing

**From Memory 01062026-ip-crisis-collaborative-ai-narrative.md**:
- "The existential crisis of modern business"
- "Treat AI providers as intelligence and treat your intellectual property like the method"
- "The deepest lever we've ever had"
- "AI as the infinitely scalable worker that carries out that vision"
- "Turn unreified, unquantified, untouchable value into something we can now quantify and manipulate"

**From ADR-001**:
- Platform positioning (not infrastructure)
- "Unified worldview eliminates strategy-execution disconnect"
- Now add: "IP-as-code enables AI leverage without IP leakage"

**From ADR-002**:
- Three pillars: Coding/Executive/Content
- Evolution: Not "three separate use cases" but "single worldview backing all three; unique value is unified context + cascading value across roles"
- Power is in the connections, not the pillars
