Memory 1: Core Product Vision
Title: ADR-001: aswritten.ai as Complete Product, Not Infrastructure Layer

Date: 2024-12-23

Context:
Capitol.ai approached us to license collective memory's semantic memory layer for integration into their workflow builder platform. This would involve building an API/MCP server that they could resell to their customers. Initial discussions included:

VCSA (Vice Chief of Staff of the Army) speech generation project (Jan 12, 2025 deadline)
Broader integration of collective memory into Capitol's core product
Potential revenue: $60K-80K over 5 months
Decision:
We are building collective memory as a complete product - a collaborative worldview layer for AI agents across coding, executive assistance, and content generation. We will NOT license the semantic memory layer as infrastructure for others to build on top of.

Rationale:

IP Protection: The narrative architecture ontology and Git-native worldview approach are our core competitive moat. Licensing this to Capitol would give away our fundamental value proposition.
Strategic Focus: Building custom API integration for Capitol would distract from shipping the actual product vision for 3-6 months. This is a critical period for validating our core hypothesis.
Market Position: We want to be a platform (complete product users adopt), not infrastructure (low-margin vendor others build on). Infrastructure providers have thin margins and high support burden.
Product Differentiation: Our value isn't "semantic memory" (a feature many can build) but the unified worldview across use cases (coding + executive + content generation sharing the same collective memory). Giving away the pieces lets others assemble the whole.
Consequences:

Revenue impact: Forgoing $60K-80K near-term revenue opportunity
Relationship: Declining Capitol engagement after investing time in scoping
Risk: Must prove product vision independently without design partner revenue
Opportunity: Full focus on building what we actually want to build
Status: Decided - communicated to Capitol.ai on 2024-12-23
