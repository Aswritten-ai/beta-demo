# GTM & Sales Strategy: Advisor-Led Seed/Series A Focus

**Date**: 2026-01-07  
**Context**: Sales target, strategy, networking, and marketing plan developed from analysis of role-based value props and strategic narrative. Scarlet's original plan was advisor outreach but needed specific customer segment focus for referrals.

## Most Effective Sales Target

### **Primary Target: Seed/Series A CEOs (via advisor network)**

**Why CEOs at this stage?**

1. **They feel the pain acutely**:
   - Small enough to see everything ("what is my team actually working on?")
   - Big enough to feel fracturing starting ("are teams working toward same vision?")
   - Directly exposed to IP leakage risk (they're often in AI conversations themselves)
   - Strategy-execution disconnect is visceral (can see when things don't align)

2. **Decision authority + budget**:
   - Can make purchase decision quickly (no lengthy procurement)
   - Can mandate org-wide adoption (critical for network effects)
   - Seed/Series A = less bureaucracy than growth stage
   - Have budget but still care about ROI (metrics matter)

3. **Network effects kick in fastest**:
   - Small team (5-50 people) = easier to get everyone on platform
   - "Useful for 1, more useful for 2+" dynamics work best when you can get 5-10 people quickly
   - Easier to demonstrate cascading value across all roles
   - Can show org-wide transformation in 30-60 days

4. **Compelling metrics at this stage**:
   - Time from pivot decision to execution: weeks → days (critical at early stage velocity)
   - Building consensus without all-hands overhead (small team needs speed)
   - Quantified IP = attractive to investors/board (VCs care about IP protection)
   - Can prove value quickly (iterate fast, show results)

**Why NOT Growth Stage / Enterprise:**
- Too much bureaucracy (long sales cycles)
- Harder to get org-wide adoption (too many people, politics)
- Network effects harder to demonstrate (takes longer to reach critical mass)
- May have entrenched tools/processes (change management overhead)

**Why NOT Solo Developers / Small Teams:**
- Value props we developed are executive/strategic (not individual productivity)
- Network effects require multiple roles collaborating
- Pricing power is with exec budget (not developer expense)
- Individual adoption doesn't necessarily spread to rest of org

---

## Vertical Focus: High-IP Technical Companies

**Target companies where:**
- **IP is the moat** (not just execution speed or network effects)
- **Heavy AI adoption** already happening (pain is acute NOW, not future)
- **Technical leadership** exists (understands git-native immediately)
- **Multiple specialized roles** (benefits from cross-role value cascade)

**Specific Verticals (Priority Order):**

1. **AI/ML Companies**
   - Ironic positioning: "You're building AI, but losing your IP to AI"
   - Heavy AI adoption = pain is most acute
   - Technical audience = understands git-native worldview
   - IP is literally the product (models, training approaches, architectures)
   - Examples: AI infrastructure, ML platforms, AI-first applications

2. **Developer Tools / Infrastructure**
   - Technical audience (gets git-native immediately)
   - Often have internal AI agents already (feel fragmentation)
   - IP = methodology + tooling + architectural patterns
   - Early adopters (willing to try new approaches)
   - Examples: Dev tools, CI/CD, observability, security tools

3. **SaaS with Proprietary Methodology**
   - Consulting-turned-product (IP = process, not just software)
   - Strategy-execution disconnect is painful (methodology must be consistent)
   - Often have Strategy/Head of Product roles (champion exists)
   - Examples: Vertical SaaS, professional services platforms, workflow tools

4. **Infrastructure/Platform Companies**
   - Architectural decisions are IP (can't afford misalignment)
   - Cross-team coordination critical (network effects matter)
   - Technical + strategic leadership (CTO + CEO care about alignment)
   - Examples: Cloud infrastructure, data platforms, API platforms

**Avoid (for now):**
- Consumer products (less clear IP, less technical)
- Non-technical SaaS (may not understand git-native)
- Services companies (IP less tangible)
- Hardware companies (different coordination challenges)

---

## Champion Within Org

**Why you need a champion:**
- CEO buys in strategically, but someone needs to pilot
- Network effects require multi-role adoption (can't be one person's tool)
- Need someone to demonstrate value before org-wide rollout
- Champion becomes internal evangelist for expansion

**Option 1: Strategy (Head of/VP Strategy)**

**Pros:**
- Feels most acute pain (consensus chase, deck versioning, "which version is authoritative?")
- Most compelling metrics (days → 15 minutes for updated materials)
- Natural evangelist (their job is alignment across org)
- Can pull in other roles organically (needs Product, Sales, Engineering to validate)
- CEO listens to Strategy (direct line to decision maker)

**Cons:**
- May not exist at seed stage (role emerges at Series A+)
- Less technical (may need help understanding git-native)
- Harder to quantify value without bringing in other roles

**Best for:** Series A+ companies with established Strategy function

---

**Option 2: CTO/VP Engineering**

**Pros:**
- Understands git-native immediately (speaks the language)
- Can pilot with eng team first (technical validation)
- Has technical credibility to explain to CEO
- Often has budget/influence (can make purchase decision)
- Engineering team feels pain acutely (context fragmentation, "random vector" implementations)

**Cons:**
- May be focused on eng-only value (harder to see cross-role benefits)
- CEO may see as "dev tool" not strategic platform
- Sales/Product may not get pulled in immediately

**Best for:** Technical founders, developer-first companies, Seed stage

---

**Option 3: CEO Direct**

**Pros:**
- Decision maker (can mandate org-wide adoption)
- Sees strategic value immediately (IP protection, consensus building)
- Can pilot across multiple roles from start (maximize network effects)

**Cons:**
- Busy (harder to get pilot time/attention)
- May delegate to Strategy/CTO anyway

**Best for:** Small teams (5-15 people) where CEO is deeply involved

---

**Ideal Combination:** 
- **CEO sponsorship** (strategic buy-in, budget approval, org mandate)
- **Strategy champion** (pilots, evangelizes, demonstrates value)
- **CTO early adopter** (technical validation, engineering team adoption)

This creates top-down mandate + bottom-up proof + cross-functional demonstration.

---

## Sales Strategy: Advisor-Led with Specific Ask

### **Phase 1: Advisor Outreach (Now - Weeks 1-2)**

**Scarlet's original plan was right: reach out to advisors and network from there.**

**Key refinement: Sharpen the ask with specific criteria**

**Instead of vague:**
"Can you introduce me to portfolio companies?"

**Use specific filtered ask:**
"I'm looking for warm intros to Seed/Series A CEOs in [AI/ML, dev tools, SaaS] who are:
1. **Heavily investing in AI adoption** (so IP leakage risk is acute)
2. **Struggling with strategy-execution alignment** (so pain is felt)
3. **Have a Head of Strategy or technical CTO** (champion exists)

Ideally companies where you've seen them struggle with keeping teams aligned or where you've had to ask 'what's actually happening?' multiple times."

**Why this works:**
- **Specific = advisors can pattern-match** (not thinking abstractly)
- **Three criteria = filters to most receptive audience** (all three conditions increase likelihood)
- **"Where you've seen them struggle" = advisors know the pain exists** (not theoretical)
- **Frames you as solving their portfolio problem** (not just selling product)

**Advisor Conversation Template:**

```
"Hey [Advisor],

I'm reaching out because I think you'd have a unique perspective on this problem I'm solving.

We're seeing early-stage technical companies face an existential tension: they're investing heavily in AI adoption (because they have to), but in the process, every employee—CEO included—is systematically giving away the company's intellectual property to AI providers.

Zero data retention helps, but it cripples AI effectiveness. The companies that get the most value from AI are the ones leaking the most IP.

We've built a git-native collaborative AI worldview system that lets companies protect their IP while still getting full value from AI. Think 'IP as code'—versionable, reviewable, collaborative across the org. Early metrics show we're cutting time from strategic decision to implementation from weeks/months down to days.

I'm looking for warm intros to Seed/Series A CEOs in [AI/ML, dev tools, infrastructure SaaS] who:
1. Are heavily invested in AI adoption (so the pain is acute)
2. Have struggled with strategy-execution alignment (so they feel the coordination problem)
3. Have a Head of Strategy or technical CTO who could champion a pilot

Basically, companies where you've found yourself asking 'what's actually happening there?' or where you've seen teams pulling in different directions despite clear strategy.

Does anyone in your portfolio come to mind?"
```

**Target: 10-15 advisors in first 2 weeks**

---

### **Phase 2: Warm Intro → CEO Pitch (Weeks 3-4)**

**Pitch Structure** (aligned with deck we developed):

**1. Hook (Existential Crisis)**
"Every employee in your company, CEO included, is telling state secrets to AI. You're investing heavily in AI adoption—because you have to—but in the process, you're systematically transferring your competitive moat into training data for models that will commoditize your differentiation."

**2. Problem (Fragmented Current State)**
Show diagram: Each role (Strategy, Product, Engineering, Sales, Design) has:
- Fragmented upstream inputs
- Siloed AI coworker (local memory, context-squished)
- Downstream outputs that may not align

"You feel this as: Which deck is authoritative? Are teams working toward the same vision? When you pivot, how long until it reaches implementation?"

**3. Why Current Solutions Fail**
"Zero data retention preserves IP but cripples AI effectiveness. You need context for AI to be valuable, but providing context leaks IP. This isn't solvable within the current paradigm of model-held memory."

**4. Mechanism (IP-as-Code + Collaborative Worldview)**
Show new diagram: 
- Center: IP-as-code repo (single source of truth)
- All roles contribute memories → extraction → worldview
- All AIs query same worldview (not siloed)
- Branch/review/merge workflow (like code)

"Git-native means versionable, reviewable, branchable. Collaborative means network effects: more people = more value to each person."

**5. Proof (Metrics)**
- Time from idea to updated materials: **days → 15 minutes**
- Time from vision shift to implementation: **weeks/months → days**
- Consensus building: **ongoing chase → built into PR review**
- Features defaulting to org direction: **inconsistent → 100%**

"These aren't projections. This is what we're seeing in early pilots."

**6. Key Differentiator**
"This isn't just 'better memory' like ChatGPT Teams or Claude Projects. Those are still model-held, black box, optimized for individuals.

This is collaborative org-wide worldview that:
- Protects your IP (outside model training)
- Creates network effects (value multiplies with more people)
- Makes IP tangible (quantified, versionable, reviewable)
- Works like your org already works (git-native)"

**7. Ask**
"Let's pilot with your [Strategy team / CTO's team] for 30 days. We'll target [specific outcome: worldview-backed strategy deck with cascading updates / engineering team aligned to strategy]. You'll see the metrics I showed you in your own org."

**Target: Pitch 5-10 CEOs, aim for 2-3 pilot commitments**

---

### **Phase 3: Pilot → Expand (Weeks 5-8)**

**Pilot Strategy:**

**Option A: Start with Strategy Team (5-10 people)**
- 30-day pilot with specific outcome: Create one worldview-backed strategy deck, show cascading updates
- Success metrics:
  - Time from strategic idea to updated deck: measure before/after
  - Visible cascading updates across disciplines (roadmap, sales brief, component specs)
  - CEO can query worldview for "where are we heading?" without asking team
- Week 2: Add second role (Sales or Product) to demonstrate network effects
- Week 4: Show value multiplication ("Sales immediately saw new product context")

**Option B: Start with Engineering Team (5-10 devs)**
- 30-day pilot: Connect worldview to coding agents, show alignment improvement
- Success metrics:
  - Features defaulting to org direction (not random vector)
  - Context queries to PM reduced (devs query AI instead)
  - Implementation aligning with customer needs
- Week 2: Add Product to show cross-role value ("Product sees tech constraints, devs see customer context")
- Week 4: Add Strategy to complete loop

**Critical: Demonstrate network effects by adding second role mid-pilot**

**Expansion After Pilot:**
- If Strategy pilot successful: expand to Product, Engineering, Sales
- If Engineering pilot successful: expand to Product, Strategy, Sales
- Target: Org-wide within 60 days of pilot start

**Success Criteria for Org-Wide Expansion:**
- Champion becomes evangelist ("This changed how we work")
- CEO sees quantified value (metrics delivered)
- Second role sees immediate benefit (network effect proven)
- Team requests expansion ("When can Sales get access?")

---

## Why NOT Developer-First PLG

**The new framing we developed is executive/strategic, not developer convenience:**

**Developer Pain (ADR-002 original framing):**
- "AI forgets context, docs go stale"
- Audience: Solo developers, small teams
- Value prop: Productivity boost, never write README again
- Signal: Nice-to-have, individual tool

**Executive Pain (New IP crisis framing):**
- "Losing IP to AI, can't align teams, can't build consensus"
- Audience: CEOs, Strategy, executives
- Value prop: Existential risk mitigation, org transformation
- Signal: Must-have, strategic platform

**Problem with developer-first entry:**
- Developer adoption doesn't necessarily spread to exec/strategy
- Value is in **cross-role network effects**, not individual productivity
- Pricing power is with exec budget (not developer expense)
- Risk of being seen as "dev tool" not strategic platform

**BUT: CTO can be champion**
- CTO understands git-native (can explain to CEO in terms they get)
- CTO has strategic seat (not just tactical)
- Engineering team adoption proves technical value
- Then expand to Strategy/Sales to prove cross-role value

**So: Not developer-first PLG, but CTO-championed strategic sale**

---

## Content Marketing Strategy

**Target Audience:** Seed/Series A CEOs, Heads of Strategy, CTOs in high-IP technical companies

**Content Themes:**

### **1. IP Crisis Series**
- **"The $XM IP Leak: Why AI Adoption is Hollowing Out Your Competitive Moat"**
  - Thesis: Every AI interaction transfers IP to model providers
  - Data: Quantify how much context typical company provides to AI
  - Hook: "You're investing in AI to compete. You're losing your moat in the process."

- **"Every Employee Tells State Secrets to AI: The Existential Crisis of Modern Business"**
  - Thesis: Individual AI adoption = systematic IP leakage
  - Examples: What a strategist, salesperson, engineer reveals in typical AI conversations
  - Hook: "Your employees aren't malicious. The system is."

- **"Why Zero Data Retention Gateways Don't Solve the IP Problem"**
  - Thesis: Context is required for value; zero retention cripples effectiveness
  - Alternative: Git-native worldview (context without leakage)
  - Hook: "You have to choose: AI effectiveness or IP protection. Or do you?"

### **2. Collaborative AI Positioning**
- **"From Single-Player to Multiplayer AI: Why Siloed Memory is Breaking Your Org"**
  - Thesis: Current AI memory = optimized for individuals, breaks at org level
  - Show: Fragmented current state vs collaborative new state
  - Hook: "Your CEO's ChatGPT and your developer's Claude don't talk. That's the problem."

- **"IP as Code: Making Your Competitive Moat Tangible, Versionable, Reviewable"**
  - Thesis: Git-native worldview makes IP manipulable (not abstract)
  - Show: What "IP as code" looks like in practice
  - Hook: "You can diff code. Why can't you diff your strategy?"

- **"The Network Effect You're Missing: Why Collaborative Worldview Beats Individual Memory"**
  - Thesis: Value multiplies with more collaborators (not linear)
  - Examples: Sales context → engineering benefit; arch decisions → sales feasibility
  - Hook: "Your AI gets smarter when your coworker talks to theirs. But it doesn't."

### **3. Use Case Deep-Dives**
- **"Strategy as Code: From Deck Version Confusion to Git-Native Consensus"**
  - Audience: Heads of Strategy, CEOs
  - Problem: Which deck is authoritative? How do I know people understand?
  - Solution: Worldview commits + PR review + cascading updates
  - Metrics: Days → 15 minutes (idea to materials)

- **"How [Company X] Cut Time from Vision to Implementation from Weeks to Days"**
  - Case study format (once we have pilot results)
  - Show: Before (fragmented) vs After (collaborative)
  - Emphasize: Cross-role network effects (not just one team)

- **"The Sales-to-Engineering Cycle: Closing the Loop in Real-Time"**
  - Audience: Sales leaders, CTOs, Product leaders
  - Problem: Salespeople don't know what's possible, engineers don't know customer needs
  - Solution: Shared worldview (sales commits client context, eng queries it)
  - Metrics: Engineer calls from sales → zero; client needs → strategy awareness (immediate)

**Distribution Channels:**

**Primary:**
- **LinkedIn** (CEO/CTO/Strategy audience; shareable by advisors)
- **Advisor sharing** (most important for warm intros; send to advisors to share with portfolio)

**Secondary:**
- **Hacker News** (technical audience; provocative framing; "Every employee tells state secrets to AI")
- **Substack/Blog** (long-form, SEO, thought leadership)
- **Twitter/X** (tech community; short provocations linking to long-form)

**Cadence:**
- 1-2 articles per week (IP crisis series first, then collaborative AI positioning)
- Share with advisors immediately (ammunition for portfolio discussions)
- Repurpose for LinkedIn posts (one article → 3-5 posts)

---

## Networking Strategy

**After advisor intros start working (4-8 weeks in), consider:**

### **Conferences/Events**

**Target:** Where early-stage technical CEOs/CTOs gather

**Priority Events:**
1. **AI Engineer Summit** (AI/ML companies; technical audience; understands problem)
2. **SaaStr** (SaaS CEOs; Series A+ focus; strategy-execution pain resonates)
3. **TechCrunch Disrupt** (investor-heavy; good for advisor connections; media coverage)
4. **Startup Grind** (early stage; CEO-focused; less technical but broad reach)

**Positioning at Events:**
- **Not**: "Developer tool" booth (wrong framing)
- **Instead**: "Strategic IP Protection for AI-Native Orgs" or "Collaborative AI Worldview Platform"
- **Demo**: Live worldview diff showing cascading updates (visual impact)
- **Conversation starter**: "How are you protecting your IP while using AI?"

**Event ROI:**
- Primary: Meet CEOs/CTOs directly (complement advisor intros)
- Secondary: Advisor connections (investors at events)
- Tertiary: Media/PR (position as thought leader)

**Avoid (for now):**
- Pure developer conferences (DevOps Days, KubeCon) unless speaking slot (audience mismatch)
- Enterprise conferences (RSA, Dreamforce) until we have enterprise traction (wrong stage)

---

## Pricing Implications

**Based on target customer (Seed/Series A CEO):**

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Per-developer pricing (signals dev tool, not platform)
- ❌ Usage-based API pricing (signals infrastructure, not transformation)
- ❌ Free tier with limits (signals PLG, not strategic sale)

**What TO do:**
- ✅ Per-org or per-team pricing (platform/transformation signal)
- ✅ Pilot pricing: Low/free for 30 days (prove value, remove risk)
- ✅ Expansion pricing: Scales with team size (5-50 people = one price band)

**Anchor to value:**
- "How much does misalignment cost you per month?" (strategy-execution disconnect)
- "What's the cost of losing your IP to model training?" (existential risk)
- "What would you pay to cut time from idea to implementation by 10x?" (weeks → days)

**Rough pricing bands (TBD based on pilot learnings):**
- **Pilot**: $0-500/month (prove value, 1-2 teams, 30-60 days)
- **Team** (5-15 people): $2-5K/month (one function: Strategy or Engineering)
- **Org-wide** (15-50 people): $10-20K/month (cross-functional, network effects)
- **Growth** (50+ people): Custom (modular worldviews, hierarchies)

**Why this works:**
- Seed/Series A has budget ($2-5K/month is manageable)
- Pricing reflects strategic value (not commodity pricing)
- Team → org-wide expansion path built in (start small, expand with proof)
- Aligns with advisor-led sales (not self-serve PLG)

---

## Immediate Action Plan

**Week 1-2: Advisor Outreach + Content**
1. ✅ Refine advisor ask (use template above)
2. ✅ Identify 10-15 advisors to reach out to (prioritize those with AI/ML, dev tools, SaaS portfolio)
3. ✅ Draft IP crisis content: "Every Employee Tells State Secrets to AI" (LinkedIn + blog)
4. ✅ Prepare CEO pitch deck (using structure we developed)
5. ✅ Send advisor outreach emails (specific filtered ask)

**Week 3-4: Intro Calls + Pitch**
6. ✅ Take warm intros from advisors (aim for 5-10 CEO intro calls)
7. ✅ Pitch CEOs using structure above (existential crisis → mechanism → metrics → pilot ask)
8. ✅ Publish IP crisis content (share with advisors to share with portfolio)
9. ✅ Target: 2-3 pilot commitments by end of week 4

**Week 5-8: Pilot + Case Study**
10. ✅ Run 30-day pilots with 2-3 companies (Strategy or Engineering team start)
11. ✅ Add second role mid-pilot (demonstrate network effects)
12. ✅ Document metrics rigorously (before/after, specific improvements)
13. ✅ Create case study from most successful pilot
14. ✅ Use case study for next wave of advisor intros ("Here's proof with [Company X]")

**Week 9-12: Expand + Refine**
15. ✅ Expand successful pilots to org-wide
16. ✅ Publish case study content (blog, LinkedIn, advisor sharing)
17. ✅ Refine pitch based on learnings (what resonated? what didn't?)
18. ✅ Next wave of advisor intros (now with social proof)

## Why This Strategy Works

**Alignment with value props:**
- Target (Seed/Series A CEOs) matches pain profile (acute, decision authority, budget)
- Vertical focus (high-IP technical) matches IP crisis framing
- Champion strategy (Strategy/CTO) matches where value is most visible
- Pilot approach (30 days, one team) proves network effects quickly

**Alignment with positioning:**
- Advisor-led signals strategic platform (not dev tool)
- CEO target signals existential problem (not productivity boost)
- Metrics-driven signals transformation (not feature)
- IP-as-code framing signals git-native technical credibility

**Alignment with product:**
- Network effects require multi-role adoption (pilot → expand model enables this)
- Git-native worldview resonates with technical buyers (CTO, technical CEO)
- Collaborative positioning differentiates from individual memory (ChatGPT Teams, Claude Projects)
- Cross-role value cascade is demonstrable in 30-60 days (small team size)

**Risk mitigation:**
- Advisor-led reduces cold outreach (warm intros = higher conversion)
- Pilot reduces buying risk (prove value before org-wide commitment)
- Specific criteria filter to receptive audience (all three conditions increase likelihood)
- Multiple pilots in parallel (not all-in on one customer)

**Expansion path:**
- Pilot success → org-wide expansion (land and expand)
- Case study → more advisor intros (flywheel)
- Early customers become references (network effects at customer level)
- Learnings refine pitch/positioning (iterate based on real feedback)

---

## Alternative Paths Considered (and Why Not)

**Developer-first PLG:**
- ❌ Value is cross-role (not individual productivity)
- ❌ Network effects require org adoption (not bottoms-up)
- ❌ Executive pain is more urgent than developer pain
- ❌ Risk: Seen as dev tool, never reaches Strategy/CEO

**Enterprise Sales (Growth stage / Large companies):**
- ❌ Too slow (long sales cycles kill early momentum)
- ❌ Too complex (change management, procurement, politics)
- ❌ Harder to prove network effects (takes longer to reach critical mass)
- ❌ Not differentiated enough yet (need early wins first)

**Direct Cold Outreach:**
- ❌ Low conversion without warm intro
- ❌ Harder to filter to receptive audience
- ❌ Less credibility without advisor backing
- ❌ Wastes time on bad fits

**Freemium/Self-Serve:**
- ❌ Wrong signal (commodity, not strategic)
- ❌ Doesn't create org-wide adoption (individuals sign up, not orgs)
- ❌ Hard to demonstrate network effects (need multiple roles)
- ❌ Pricing power lost (can't anchor to strategic value)

## Key Language/Framing

**From Strategic Analysis:**
- "Every employee in your company, CEO included, is telling state secrets to AI"
- "You're investing heavily in AI adoption—because you have to—but in the process, you're systematically transferring your competitive moat"
- "Git-native collaborative AI worldview system"
- "IP as code—versionable, reviewable, collaborative across the org"
- "Time from strategic decision to implementation: weeks/months → days"
- "Not just 'better memory'—collaborative org-wide worldview that protects IP while enabling AI"
- "Network effects: more people = more value to each person"
- "Useful for one person, even more useful for two+"

**Advisor Ask Template Key Phrases:**
- "Existential tension: investing heavily in AI adoption but giving away IP"
- "Companies that get most value from AI are the ones leaking the most IP"
- "Heavily invested in AI adoption (so pain is acute)"
- "Struggled with strategy-execution alignment (so they feel the coordination problem)"
- "Companies where you've found yourself asking 'what's actually happening there?'"

**End of memory**
