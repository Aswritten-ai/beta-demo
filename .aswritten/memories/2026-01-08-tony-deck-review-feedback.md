# Tony Deck Review Feedback: Major Strategic Validation & Direction

**Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Context**: Weekly call with Tony Maley reviewing the witness/onboarding crisis pitch deck (prepared for advisor intros). Tony gave extensive feedback on positioning, target market, and go-to-market strategy. This represents major validation of the pivot from content generation to onboarding crisis framing.  
**Related**: Memory 01072026-ip-reframing-onboarding-crisis-primary-hook.md (onboarding crisis framing), memory 01082026-witness-terminology-framework-final.md (terminology), deck file prepared for review

## Tony's Overall Reaction

**Critical validation:**
> "This is a way better approach for you. This is a much more immediate, acute problem for organizations."

> "This is awesome. Yeah, this is amazing. Scarlet, it's exactly right for me. I think you should absolutely be leaning into this right now."

> "This is a massive improvement. [Ready to scale up] for me."

> "I could sell this all day long. This is an easy sell, I think. I know I could sell this way."

**Strategic shift endorsed:** Tony explicitly said the onboarding crisis / organizational memory framing is dramatically better than the previous content generation positioning he'd seen before.

---

## CRITICAL FEEDBACK #1: Don't Lead with Cost - Lead with Pain

### **Tony's exact words:**

> "You're making the point you're going straight to the cost. But that's not the problem. **Cost isn't the problem, actually. It's a way to measure the problem.** Right. The problem is **people have no fucking clue what to do when they join a company.**"

> "**That's the value. It's not the money.** The money is there for the procurement guys. For ROI, sure, you need the slide, but it's for a different audience."

> "Just not having to stop what I'm doing to tell somebody something all the fucking time. Yeah, I'm in. Yeah, right. **I don't care what it costs. I don't care the money that I'm saving. Just take that pain away from me.**"

### **What this means for the deck:**

**Current structure (wrong order):**
- Lead with 5 interlocking costs ($214K onboarding, $90K departures, etc.)
- Quantified pain upfront
- Cost as primary hook

**Tony's recommended structure:**
1. **Pain first (human problem):** "New people have NO IDEA what to do when they join"
2. **Secondary pain (decision maker's pain):** "I spend all day answering questions instead of doing my job"
3. **Solution:** The witness, how it works
4. **Proof:** Demo, case studies
5. **Value by role:** Qualitative benefits (time freed, productivity, alignment)
6. **Cost last (for procurement):** $1.6M/year quantified ROI

**Key insight:** Decision makers (CEOs, heads of strategy, CTOs) care about **operational pain**, not ROI. CFO/procurement care about ROI. Different audiences, different slides.

**Tony's framing of the value:**
> "You have an account, tell it, here's your fucking pack. AI is going to tell you, here's the goals that I'm going to give you one meeting, go and do it and send me updates."

> "That's the value. Not the money."

**Implication:** Lead every pitch with: "Your new people don't know what to do. Your AI can fix that." NOT "You're losing $214K/year."

---

## CRITICAL FEEDBACK #2: Target Market - Avoid Tech Startups (For Now)

### **Tony's exact words:**

> "**Stay away from tech startups.** Because they'll just want to do it themselves."

> "That's the problem you'll have with us, right, is the Christoph builds me. We'll see different ways to do it. We'll start well... **Those guys are the problem. You'll do nothing but talk about philosophical changes to your approach.**"

> "Yeah. I mean, they're. They're going to get the code and blah, blah. Actually, it's an incredible, powerful tool for tech startups I just don't think you go there now. **Prove it with the creative agency or someone.** Right?"

> "And then show the effect that it can have. This should be, oh, I'm going to start a tech startup. Okay, well, I need. What do I need to get started? Right. **First thing, I need this to start. That's tool one, right?** Okay. What's tool two? In a tech startup, that's where this would go."

### **Strategic implications:**

**Primary target (now):**
- Creative agencies
- Consulting firms
- Methodology-heavy companies
- Digital agencies (Scarlet's instinct was correct)

**Why avoid tech startups now:**
- Technical founders want to build it themselves
- Will engage in endless philosophical debates about approach
- Will distract from proving product-market fit
- Already thinking about the problem (Tony's own company is proof)

**Tech startups later (positioning shift):**
- "Tool #1 when starting a company"
- After proving it with non-technical companies
- Position as infrastructure, not product to debate

**Tony's framing:**
> "I mean, like, you know, you're going to go. Yeah. I mean, it's like that. That's the problem. Those guys are the problem."

Scarlet's response validated Tony's instinct:
> "I think the other reason for that, I think I'll be philosophically and creatively happier working with people that are doing more strategy, narrative, creative work, you know."

Tony: "Exactly. But that's the majority of companies in the world front."

**Deck change:** Move "Digital Agency/Consulting" to top of verticals list. De-emphasize or remove "AI/ML companies" from primary targets. Reframe tech startups as "eventually: infrastructure play."

---

## CRITICAL FEEDBACK #3: Need Case Studies IMMEDIATELY

### **Tony's exact words:**

> "**You need to go and find two small companies. Yeah. And just give them this.**"

> "**An example of what someone did with this would be amazing. That's what you're missing.**"

> "The burning doubt in people's minds when they're looking at this is, yeah, that's okay for you, but **what if I'm a MBA grad or a vet, Can I use this?** Can it really be used? Are they going to be able to do this and keep it up? And is it just a nice thing, that shiny object that you get and don't know how to use and cancel?"

### **Recommended approach:**

**Tony's advice on pricing for case studies:**
> "Well, I think you play that game there. It's like, look, this is what I'm looking to get out of it, right? So I'm willing to give it to you at cost. If you can't afford it, I'll try and give you it for free. But if you can, you know, it's like, you know, in a nicer way you say, you know, if you can give me something towards this or did you see value? You. We have a conversation about right for it, right? But right now I need to show this working for real. And I think the value is going to be immense for you. So when you start seeing the value, let's talk about."

**Specific case study strategy:**
1. Find 2 small companies (creative agencies, consulting, methodology-heavy)
2. BYO key (they use their own API keys, not burning Scarlet's compute)
3. Free or very low cost ($100-500 token payment)
4. Agreement: Can show relevant content/progress as examples (anonymized or attributed)
5. 30-60 day pilot with specific outcomes

**What case study needs to show:**
- Start state: Team of X people, these roles, these pain points
- Implementation: How they started using it, what they witnessed
- Results: Time savings, productivity gains, specific examples
- Testimonial: "In their words..." from champion

**Tony's concern about simulations:**
> "No, yeah, it really doesn't [help]. Because the burning doubt in people's minds when they're looking at this is, yeah, that's okay for you, but what if I'm a MBA grad or a vet, Can I use this?"

**Implication:** Before/after examples from collective memory (like we created) are helpful, but **real customer examples from non-technical users** are essential for closing sales.

**Deck addition:** Add "Case Studies" section after "Solution" or before "ROI Summary" showing:
- Company profile (size, industry, roles)
- Before state (pain points, time waste)
- After state (improvements, testimonials)
- Quantified results (time saved, productivity gained)

---

## CRITICAL FEEDBACK #4: This is "Anti-Enterprise"

### **Tony's exact words:**

> "**I would even say that this is anti enterprise.**"

(When Scarlet said target is Seed/Series A CEOs in small companies)

> "If you're selling to small companies, this is easy actually. Right."

> "But in any small company with lots of things to keep track of and onboard people, quite a decent interval. Right? Yeah, **they need this. In fact, it becomes a superpower for a small company.**"

### **Strategic implications:**

**Validation of target:** Scarlet's instinct about 5-50 person companies is correct.

**Why small companies:**
- Network effects work fast (5-10 people = everyone sees value immediately)
- Decision cycles fast (CEO can mandate, no procurement)
- Pain is acute (small teams feel onboarding/knowledge loss viscerally)
- Becomes "superpower" (competitive advantage vs larger companies)

**Why NOT enterprise (reinforces earlier vouch lessons):**
- Long sales cycles (3+ years)
- Bureaucracy, compliance, review processes
- Multi-stakeholder buy-in required
- Huge effort even to get through door

**Tony's experience with vouch:**
> "The big problem is I just got really frustrated not being in control of the finances. The enterprise life cycle for sales was just killing me."

> "The product was right. The problem was. Well, it's been a horrible year economically for companies like Vouch. Right. But that waiting until companies are ready and getting through all the compliance steps. Review steps. It is multi year."

**Implication:** Double down on small company positioning. Don't hedge toward "also works for enterprise." Keep it focused.

**Deck change:** Target customer section should emphasize small company advantages, not apologize for not being enterprise-ready.

---

## CRITICAL FEEDBACK #5: Abstract Away Technical Language

### **Tony's exact words:**

> "Git native and all the rest of it. **The people who need this... has no understanding what code. Code is. Or a care in the world about it** or what git is or how it's versioned or how it works. **They just want it to work.**"

> "**Abstract that language up.** It's like that's always your data, you own it and it's under your control and blah, blah. And it's this one that makes sense."

> "The big thing for them will be, **is there a big eject button where I keep everything?** And the answer is yes. Right, yeah. You own the repo."

> "Yeah, yeah. So you just need to abstract that language up."

### **What this means:**

**Keep technical language:** In "How it works technically" section (for credibility, for technical champions like CTOs)

**Abstract for non-technical audiences:**
- "Git-native collective memory" → "Your data, your control, always yours"
- "Commit to the witness" → "Save it so everyone's AI knows"
- "Query the snapshot" → "Ask your AI anything about the company"
- "Branch/review/merge" → "Test changes before making them real"

**Emphasize ownership/control:**
- "You own the repository" → "It's your data, in your account"
- "Git-native" → "Version-controlled (like how developers work)"
- "Can export/migrate anytime" → "Never locked in, always portable"

**Tony's framing of what they care about:**
> "Is there a big eject button where I keep everything?"

Answer: Yes, you own the repo, it's in your GitHub account, you can export/migrate/delete anytime.

**Deck change:** 
- Move technical architecture details later in deck
- Lead with benefits in plain language
- Add "Your Data, Your Control" messaging prominently
- Keep one technical section for CTOs/engineers

## What Tony Specifically Loved

### **1. The Real-Time Demo**

**Tony's reaction when seeing Claude save memory:**
> "**So powerful. That is so powerful.**"

(After seeing Scarlet work in Claude, save a memory, and show it sync)

> "That's it. That's powerful."

**Implication:** Live demo of "working in Claude → AI suggests witnessing → save memory → done" is the killer demonstration. More powerful than slides.

---

### **2. The PR Review / Cascading Updates**

**When Scarlet explained automatic document regeneration:**
> "That is very cool."

**When explaining branching to test changes:**
> "Yeah, this is awesome. Yeah, this is amazing. Scarlet, it's exactly right for me."

**Specific feature loved:** 
- Create memory on new branch
- See how every document across org changes as result
- Review PR with cascading updates
- Decide whether to merge

Scarlet's explanation:
> "I'm like, I want to see how the decks change, how the sales strategy changes, how the onboarding doc changes, how the landing page changes as a result of a conversation with AI where we decided to say we're going to abandon all tech startups in our marketing and here are the words that I want to use in approaching, you know, these other things, right? And we can see that cascade and then review it and decide whether we want to accept that as an organization."

Tony's response:
> "Yeah, this is awesome. Yeah, this is amazing. Scarlet, it's exactly right for you. I think you should absolutely be leaning into this right now."

**Implication:** Demo should show:
1. Working with AI (normal conversation)
2. AI suggests witnessing something
3. Save memory (create branch)
4. Show PR with regenerated docs
5. Review changes across documents
6. Merge (or discard)

This demonstrates both simplicity (just save memory) and power (organization-wide impact).

---

### **3. "Organization as Code" Concept**

**Tony's reaction:**
> "You think about all the vision narrative stuff that we did. Imagine if that was just controlled in this way."

Scarlet: "It would have been completely different. Completely different. It would have taken like three weeks instead of however long."

Tony: "Yeah, but that frustration of. Okay, right. We think this is the way to go to prove that out took monumental effort."

Scarlet: "Well, and that's the thing is if I have this idea, this cool idea about a new narrative, then what does that mean for every single project across the organization that takes of the most months, if not years to rework and regenerate, and in this approach, it takes 15 minutes and you can say, oh, no."

Tony: "**Incredibly powerful.**"

**Implication:** The vouch narrative work as case study for how painful current process is, and how fast this would make it.

---

### **4. Alignment with Tony's Own Approach**

**Tony revealed he's building similar system internally:**
> "This is scary. We're clearly aligned, as always. Literally, Zill and I were talking about, as we start sales, that's how we do it. We put everything back in. And we literally don't have any other way to interface for sales. Actually, it's. It becomes the way you do it."

**What Tony's building for his company (Verity):**
> "I've literally built the company as Doctrine and AI. I've literally defined everything that I want the company to be. The operating models, the influences academically, the way I want things to be tested, the canonical ways that we should think about governance and all of that. Right. I've built a whole model and then I use that in the LLM to help me then navigate Everything. Right. So that's like to me, building everything out from that base. Right. So essentially the whole company is in GitHub."

> "Everything is modeled. And every decision is essentially a pull request for the company. Not just code or content or anything. Who we are, what we do, what we stand for, how we operate. Every single thing I've done that way."

**Tony's realization:**
> "The whole thing is modeled. Everything is modeled. And every decision is essentially a pull request for the company. Not just code or content or anything. Who we are, what we do, what we stand for, how we operate."

**Validation:** Tony is independently building toward the same solution, which proves:
1. The need is real (he's feeling it acutely)
2. The approach is sound (he's converging on similar architecture)
3. But he doesn't want to build the product (would rather use yours)

**Tony's acknowledgment:**
> "Yeah, the stuff I'm putting in there is like I started with a white paper on how I want the product to be all the kind of things I was saying. Right. And then created like a dependency log. And that was my attempt to essentially stop me from creating content without understanding where it linked."

Scarlet: "No, it's very similar. I mean, yeah, my concept is you want to create these sort of intentional that right now AI memory is unintentional. Right. There's just this behind the scenes continuous process and instead we want distinct memories and those memories can be fucking anything."

Tony: "Yeah, I mean it sounds super sophisticated compared to where my brain's at. Right. So I'd love [to try it]."

Scarlet: "It's really not complicated in the use though."

**Implication:** Tony is proof of concept - technical founder who understands the problem deeply, tried to build his own version, and would rather use a proper product. Perfect early adopter.

## Tony's Offer to Help with Sales

### **Tony's exact words:**

> "**Maybe I'll do sales for you part time.**"

> "I'm telling you, **I think I could sell this one. I really do. In fact, I know I could sell this way.**"

> "**The problem clarification takes seconds. The questions that follow that to convert to a sale are really obvious as well.** I think I could sell us."

> "**Could sell this all day long, by the way. This is an easy sell, I think.**"

Later in conversation:
> "Yeah. Yeah. Let me think about that. I think while I'm getting this [Verity] moving, I could definitely help you do that and then see where both go. Yeah, if you're up for that. **But I could definitely sell this. This is killer.**"

### **Why Tony thinks it's easy to sell:**

> "Something about, I mean, like on my own voyage of discovery this last month, using these tools, you know, as always, it unlocks big ideas. Right. I'm a system builder. That's the problem. Yeah. **The thing that's really clear for me is this is the tipping point on such a fundamental change of how we codify communication across teams.**"

> "**And everyone has that problem.** The problem clarification takes seconds. Yeah. The questions that follow that to convert to a sale are really obvious as well."

### **Sales structure Tony sees:**

> "I think this ends up being that, you know, **we need four things to start our tech company and this is one of them.**"

(For non-tech companies, even simpler - they just need it)

### **Tony's network:**

Tony has strong network in:
- Consulting/agency space (different from Scarlet's)
- UK/Europe companies
- Enterprise contacts (even though not targeting enterprise now, could be warm intro sources)
- Technical founders (eventually, when ready for that market)

### **Proposed arrangement:**

Scarlet: "I'll give you a percentage if you want to sell this. Absolutely."

Tony: Interested but wants to think about it while getting Verity moving

**Implication:** Tony as part-time sales could be powerful - he gets the product deeply, can explain it clearly, has complementary network, and is genuinely excited about it.

---

## Tony's Advice on Product Positioning

### **On why this works for small companies:**

> "But in any small company with lots of things to keep track of and onboard people, quite a decent interval. Right? Yeah, they need this. **In fact, it becomes a superpower for a small company.**"

**Framing for small companies:** Not "we're too small for enterprise tools" but "this makes small companies competitive with large companies by giving everyone institutional knowledge immediately."

---

### **On the problem with being great storytellers:**

> "I'm talking about, you know, where. Where did we make the wrong choices and vouch and a lot of the division stuff like constant loops and vision because we're chasing revenue versus building sustainable product to sell. Right? But **being really amazing storytellers is also a problem.**"

> "I mean, it's a superpower, right? But it's also a problem **if you don't have anchor.**"

> "And what crossed my mind is that's what an LLM is. **Incredible storyteller. And if you don't give it anchor, it doesn't mean anything.**"

**Implication:** This product IS the anchor. It grounds storytelling (human or AI) in consistent organizational truth.

**Positioning opportunity:** "Your AI is an incredible storyteller. This makes sure it tells YOUR story, not a generic one."

---

### **On what the product actually does (Tony's framing):**

Scarlet's explanation:
> "The other half of this, though, is when your employee leaves, you lose everything. Right. Like when I left Vouch, you lost every. All of my AI. Context was incredibly valuable."

Tony: "Yeah. Yeah."

Scarlet: "Like, there's no way you could have kept it."

Tony: "No."

**Tony validated this is real problem he felt with vouch.**

---

### **On the shift in what you're working on:**

Scarlet explained:
> "And that's the thing that I realized really quickly is this product shifts what you're working on from the assets at the edge of the tree. Right. All the documents that we're used to thinking of as deliverables are actually assets at the edge of the tree. Right. They're at the edge of the graph. They're not really that important. They are surf of the tip of the iceberg that reflect some small piece of what is underneath. What is the organization as a whole."

> "But we're never actually working. We're never talking about the organization as a whole, really. We're always just trying to get there. And what we can do now is create a true model of what the organization as a whole is, of what it believes, of what its process is, of what its methodology is, of all of it. All of that stuff. Right. And now when we're changing something at the leaf that's now creating a delta at the core, and we can now talk about that directly. Right. We're working on the organization as a core."

Tony: "**Yeah. You think about all the vision narrative stuff that we did. Imagine if that was just controlled in this way.**"

**This resonated deeply with Tony's vouch experience.**

---

## Strategic Decisions from This Call

### **1. Deck structure change: Pain first, cost last**
- Lead with "new people don't know what to do"
- Lead with "I spend all day answering questions"
- Move ROI slides to end (for procurement)

### **2. Target market: Double down on non-tech**
- Creative agencies, consulting, methodology-heavy (PRIMARY)
- Tech startups later, positioned as "tool #1"
- Explicitly avoid enterprise

### **3. Immediate priority: Get 2 case studies**
- Find 2 small companies (5-20 people)
- Creative agency or consulting ideal
- BYO key, free or low-cost
- 30-60 day pilot with permission to share results

### **4. Abstract technical language**
- Keep one technical section for CTOs
- Lead with benefits in plain language for CEOs/strategy
- Emphasize "your data, your control"

### **5. Demo is critical**
- Live demo of working in Claude → save memory → see sync
- Show PR review with cascading document updates
- Don't just show slides

### **6. Sales support from Tony**
- Tony offered to help sell part-time
- "Could sell this all day long"
- Different network than Scarlet's
- Could accelerate GTM significantly

## Tony's Framing of the Value (for Sales)

**Problem statement (Tony's language):**
> "The problem is people have no fucking clue what to do when they join a company. That's the problem and that's the problem I want to solve when Someone joins my company, **I don't want to have to tell them what to do and what has happened before and where things are and what we do for this and what we do for that.**"

**Value statement (Tony's language):**
> "See, just not having to stop what I'm doing to tell somebody something all the fucking time. Yeah, I'm in. Yeah, right. **I don't care what it costs.**"

**Sales close (Tony's language):**
> "You have an account, tell it, here's your fucking pack. AI is going to tell you, here's the goals that I'm going to give you one meeting, go and do it and send me updates."

**This is the sales pitch Tony would use - and it's powerful.**

---

## Validation of Product Direction

**Tony's overall assessment:**
> "This is a way better approach for you. This is a much more immediate, acute problem for organizations."

(Compared to previous content generation positioning)

> "This is a massive improvement. [Ready to scale up] for me."

> "I think you should absolutely be leaning into this right now."

> "**My advice from earlier [about getting customers first]? Yeah. I changed that.**" (Because the product is ready enough and valuable enough to sell now)

**What changed Tony's mind:**
1. Seeing the actual product working (live demo in Claude)
2. The PR review / cascading updates feature
3. The onboarding crisis framing (vs content generation)
4. Realizing he's trying to build the same thing himself

**Tony's conclusion:**
> "**This is playtime for you. 100%. People need it and they're ready for it.**"

---

## Tony's Context (For Understanding His Feedback)

**Tony's background:**
- Founder of Vouch (identity/background verification company)
- Experienced 3+ year enterprise sales cycles (painful)
- Now pivoting to Verity (compliance/background checks)
- Building "company as doctrine" internally (similar approach to collective memory)
- Deeply technical but focused on non-technical sales

**Tony's current state:**
- Paused Vouch (enterprise sales too slow, capital constrained)
- Starting Verity (faster revenue model, compliance focus)
- Looking to raise funding (right approach this time)
- Building everything as "company as source code" in GitHub

**Why Tony's feedback matters:**
1. He's lived the pain (vouch's struggle with enterprise)
2. He's building similar solution (validates need)
3. He understands product deeply (technical background)
4. He sees how to sell it (sales experience)
5. He's your ideal customer profile (methodology-heavy, technical, small team)

**Tony as potential pilot customer:**
Scarlet offered to set Tony up with the product as case study. Tony accepted:
> "Yeah, let's try it. My genuine worry there is that we just have 700,000 ideas and derail it, or try to break it and change it, or go in a totally different direction and we're up here in the ass for you. But, yeah, I'd love to try it."

Scarlet: "Well, I'm. At least I think I'm. I would worry about that more if I didn't know you so well, because I both know you well enough to not care if I don't do what you say, and also well enough that I think I can pick through the ideas and think, take what I want and leave the rest, you know?"

**Implication:** Tony will be early beta user AND potentially part-time sales, which is ideal.

---

## Other Context from Call

### **Tony's new venture (Verity):**
- Background check / compliance infrastructure
- "Evidence first" approach (reusable cryptographic evidence)
- Compliance as control plane for regulated industries
- Goal: Get VC-backed, move fast (not self-funded like Vouch)
- Looking for letter of intent from companies like Dropbox

**Lessons from Vouch applied to Verity:**
- Don't chase revenue early (build sustainable product first)
- Get funded properly (not self-funded)
- Faster revenue model (background checks drive revenue while building platform)
- Avoid enterprise (start with faster sales cycles)

**These lessons directly inform his advice to Scarlet.**

---

## Next Actions (From This Feedback)

### **Immediate (this week):**
1. Revise deck with pain-first structure
2. Add case study section (even if empty/"coming soon")
3. Abstract technical language in non-technical sections
4. Update target market section (lead with agencies/consulting)

### **Short-term (2-4 weeks):**
5. Find 2 companies for case studies (creative agencies or consulting)
6. Set up Tony as beta user (he offered)
7. Run 30-60 day pilots with agreement to share results
8. Create demo video showing real-time workflow

### **Medium-term (1-3 months):**
9. Get case studies with testimonials
10. Add case study content to deck
11. Explore Tony's part-time sales offer (if he's interested after trying product)
12. Use case studies to raise angel funding

### **Long-term strategy validated:**
- Small companies (5-50 people)
- Non-technical industries first (agencies, consulting)
- Tech startups later (as "tool #1")
- Advisor-led sales (Tony validates this approach)
- Fast pilots (30-60 days, not 6-12 months)

## Key Quotes to Remember (Sales Language)

**Problem:**
> "People have no fucking clue what to do when they join a company."

**Pain:**
> "Just not having to stop what I'm doing to tell somebody something all the fucking time."

**Value:**
> "You have an account, tell it, here's your fucking pack. AI is going to tell you."

**Not about money:**
> "I don't care what it costs. I don't care the money that I'm saving. Just take that pain away from me."

**Easy sell:**
> "Could sell this all day long. The problem clarification takes seconds."

**Becomes superpower:**
> "This becomes a superpower for a small company."

---

**Summary:** Tony's feedback represents major validation of the onboarding crisis positioning and provides clear, actionable direction for deck structure, target market, and go-to-market strategy. His offer to help with sales and his own use of similar internal systems proves both the need and the approach. Key changes: lead with pain not cost, target non-tech companies first, get case studies immediately, and abstract technical language for non-technical buyers.
